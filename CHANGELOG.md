## [v0.1.0] - 2026-02-09

See also the [v0.1.0 GitHub milestone][ms-v0.1.0].

### Security

- Go version has been updated to prevent the possibility of exploiting the Go vulnerabilities fixed in [1.25.7][go-1.25.7].

### Changed

- The project name has been changed from "AdGuard DNS Client" to "AdGuard DNS CLI".

  > [!WARNING]
  > This is a breaking change for existing MSI installations as well as for service installations, so those should be manually uninstalled before installing the new version.

    1. Make a backup of the existing configuration file (if any).
    1. Uninstall the AdGuard DNS Client:
        - To uninstall the existing MSI installation, use the original `.msi` installer with "Uninstall" option or the "Add or Remove Programs" control panel.
        - To uninstall the existing service, use the `AdGuardDNSClient` executable with the following command:

          ```sh
          ./AdGuardDNSClient -s uninstall
          ```

    1. Install the AdGuard DNS CLI.
    1. Restore the configuration file (if any).

## [v0.0.4] - 2025-05-06

See also the [v0.0.4 GitHub milestone][ms-v0.0.4].

### Security

- Any simultaneous requests that are considered duplicates will now only result in a single request to upstreams, reducing the chance of a cache poisoning attack succeeding.  This is controlled by the new configuration object `dns.server.pending_requests`, which has a single `enabled` property, set to `true` by default.

    **NOTE:** We thank [Xiang Li][mr-xiang-li] for reporting this security issue.  It's strongly recommended to leave it enabled, otherwise AdGuardDNSCLI will be vulnerable to untrusted clients.

- Go version has been updated to prevent the possibility of exploiting the Go vulnerabilities fixed in [Go 1.24.2][go-1.24.2].

### Changed

#### Configuration changes

In this release, the schema version has changed from 2 to 3.

- The new object `pending_requests` has been added to the `dns.server` object.

    ```yaml
    # BEFORE:
    dns:
        server:
            # …
        # …
    # …
    schema_version: 2

    # AFTER:
    dns:
        server:
            pending_requests:
                enabled: true
            # …
        # …
    # …
    schema_version: 3
    ```

To rollback this change, remove the `dns.server.pending_requests` object and set the `schema_version` to `2`.

## [v0.0.3] - 2025-04-01

See also the [v0.0.3 GitHub milestone][ms-v0.0.3].

### Security

- Go version has been updated to prevent the possibility of exploiting the Go vulnerabilities fixed in [Go 1.24.1][go-1.24.1].

### Changed

#### Configuration changes

In this release, the schema version has changed from 1 to 2.

- The new object `bind_retry` has been added to the `dns.server` object.

    ```yaml
    # BEFORE:
    dns:
        server:
            # …
        # …
    # …
    schema_version: 1

    # AFTER:
    dns:
        server:
            bind_retry:
                enabled: true
                interval: 1s
                count: 4
            # …
        # …
    # …
    schema_version: 2
    ```

To rollback this change, remove the `dns.server.bind_retry` object and set the `schema_version` to `1`.

### Fixed

- Failed binding to listen addresses when installed as Windows service ([#11]).

[ms-v0.0.3]: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardDNSCLI/milestone/3?closed=1

## [v0.0.2] - 2024-11-08

See also the [v0.0.2 GitHub milestone][ms-v0.0.2].

### Security

- Go version has been updated to prevent the possibility of exploiting the Go vulnerabilities fixed in [Go 1.23.3][go-1.23.3].

### Added

- MSI installer for the ARM64 architecture in addition to the existing x86 and x64 installers.

### Changed

- Path to the executable is now validated when the application installs itself as a `launchd` service on macOS ([#2]).

### Fixed

- The `syslog` log output on macOS ([#3]).

  **NOTE:** The implementation is actually a workaround for a known [Go issue][go-59229], and uses the `/usr/bin/logger` utility. This approach is suboptimal and will be improved once the Go issue is resolved.
- DNS proxy logs being written to `stderr` instead of `log.output` ([#1]).
